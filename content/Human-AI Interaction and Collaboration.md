# Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration

## Summary
Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration encompasses various interdisciplinary approaches aimed at creating more effective, ethical, and user-friendly AI systems that can seamlessly integrate with human capabilities. This field combines insights from human modeling, which focuses on developing computational models to predict and interpret human behavior, with the principles of Human-Centered AI (HCAI), which emphasizes designing AI systems with a deep understanding of human contexts and needs. Key aspects include robot communication, where research has focused on developing methods for robots to effectively express their limitations to human users, and goal inference, which involves predicting human intentions based on observed behavior. These approaches collectively contribute to improving the accuracy of human behavior predictions, enhancing transparency and interpretability of AI systems, fostering better human-robot relationships, and ultimately creating AI technologies that can adapt to human sociocultural contexts while addressing critical issues of social responsibility, fairness, and accountability.
