# Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration

## Summary
Human-AI Interaction and Collaboration is a multifaceted field that aims to create seamless and effective partnerships between humans and artificial intelligence systems. This area encompasses several key aspects, including human modeling, which focuses on developing computational models to predict and interpret human behavior; human-centered AI, which emphasizes designing AI systems with a deep understanding of human contexts and needs; robot communication, which explores methods for robots to effectively express their capabilities and limitations to human users; and goal inference, which involves predicting human intentions based on observed behavior. By integrating these components, researchers seek to develop AI systems that can adapt to human sociocultural contexts, communicate transparently, and work collaboratively with humans. The ultimate goal is to create AI technologies that enhance human capabilities, improve team performance, and foster positive human-AI relationships across various applications.
