# AI System Design and Governance

## Summary
AI System Design and Governance is a critical area of research that explores innovative approaches to managing and securing large-scale artificial intelligence systems. One promising concept in this field is Shared Model Governance through model splitting, which offers a more scalable alternative to traditional techniques like homomorphic encryption and secure multiparty computation. This approach involves dividing deep learning models among multiple parties and evaluates security through the "model completion problem." Research in this area has revealed that the difficulty of model completion is influenced more by the type and location of missing parameters than their quantity, and is particularly challenging in reinforcement learning scenarios. These findings suggest that model splitting could be a viable method for shared model governance, especially in resource-intensive training environments, potentially revolutionizing how we design and govern complex AI systems while maintaining security and efficiency.
