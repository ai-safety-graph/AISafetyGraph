# AI Safety and Reproducibility Establishing Robust Foundations for the Neuropsychology of Human Values
http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.04307v3
## Abstract
We propose the creation of a systematic effort to identify and replicate key findings in neuropsychology and allied fields related to understanding human values. Our aim is to ensure that research underpinning the value alignment problem of artificial intelligence has been sufficiently validated to play a role in the design of AI systems.
