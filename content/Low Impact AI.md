# Low Impact AI

## Summary
 Low Impact AI is an approach to AI safety that focuses on limiting the potential negative consequences of powerful AI systems by constraining their ability to significantly modify the world, even if given potentially dangerous or simplistic goals. Rather than solely concentrating on constructing inherently safe AI goals, this method aims to develop a general concept of "low impact" that can be applied to AI systems. The approach involves defining and grounding what constitutes low impact, while also exploring ways to allow for desired impacts within these constraints. This strategy offers an alternative to traditional AI control methods and aims to mitigate risks associated with superintelligent or highly capable AI. However, the concept of Low Impact AI is still being developed, with ongoing research addressing known challenges and exploring further refinements to the approach.
