# AI-Generated Code Security

## Summary
 AI-generated code security is an emerging concern in the field of AI-assisted software development, particularly with tools like GitHub Copilot. This subtopic focuses on the potential risks associated with using AI systems to automatically generate code, as these systems may inadvertently learn from and reproduce vulnerabilities present in their training data. Research in this area involves systematically assessing the security implications of AI-generated code contributions, examining factors such as the prevalence of vulnerabilities, the impact of different prompts and scenarios, and the performance across various domains and weakness types. Studies have shown that a significant portion of AI-generated code may contain security flaws, highlighting the need for careful evaluation and mitigation strategies when incorporating AI-generated code into software development processes.
