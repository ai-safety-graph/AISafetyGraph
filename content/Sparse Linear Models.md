# Sparse Linear Models

## Summary
 Sparse linear models in the context of AI alignment research involve incorporating sparsity into the linear layers of neural networks to enhance interpretability and debuggability while maintaining high accuracy. This approach allows for more human-interpretable explanations of model decisions by fitting sparse linear models over learned deep feature representations. The resulting sparse explanations can be valuable for identifying spurious correlations, understanding misclassifications, and diagnosing model biases in various tasks, such as computer vision and natural language processing. By leveraging sparse linear layers, researchers can create more transparent and debuggable deep networks, which is crucial for ensuring the alignment of AI systems with human values and intentions. This method provides a promising avenue for addressing the black-box nature of traditional deep learning models and improving our ability to understand and control their behavior.
