# AI Safety State Analysis

## Summary
AI Safety State Analysis is a critical area of research that employs quantitative methods to assess the current landscape and future trajectory of AI alignment efforts. This approach utilizes data-driven techniques, such as bibliometric analysis, to objectively evaluate emerging trends, identify knowledge gaps, and pinpoint potential areas for future investigation. Recent analyses have revealed a significant uptick in AI safety research since 2015, underscoring the field's growing importance. Key open issues, including explainability and value alignment, have been identified through these quantitative studies, with value alignment emerging as the most crucial long-term research topic. Additionally, these analyses have exposed a notable lack of research into concrete AI policies, despite the anticipated profound impact of AI on society. By leveraging quantitative methodologies, researchers can gain valuable insights into the state of AI alignment research, enabling more informed decision-making about where to concentrate future efforts in shaping the development of safe and beneficial artificial intelligence.
