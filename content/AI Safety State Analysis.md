# AI Safety State Analysis

## Summary
AI Safety State Analysis is a critical approach in AI alignment research that employs quantitative methodologies to assess the current state and future trajectory of the field. This data-driven approach has revealed significant growth in AI safety research since 2015, highlighting its increasing importance. Through techniques such as bibliometric analysis, researchers have identified key open issues, with value alignment emerging as the most crucial long-term research topic. The analysis has also uncovered important gaps, such as a lack of research into concrete AI policies, despite the technology's expected profound societal impact. By providing an objective view of the field's development, AI Safety State Analysis enables researchers to make informed decisions about future research directions and helps shape the course of AI development to ensure its alignment with human values and safety concerns.
