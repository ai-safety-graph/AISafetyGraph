# AI Debate

## Summary
 AI Debate is a concept proposed to address situations where humans may struggle to accurately assess AI-generated solutions to complex problems. As introduced by Irving et al. (2018), this approach involves pitting two AI systems against each other in a debate format, with the aim of enhancing a human judge's ability to evaluate the proposed solutions. Recent research has developed a mathematical framework to model such debates and suggests that the effectiveness of debate designs should be measured by the accuracy of the most persuasive answer. A simplified version called "feature debate" has been analyzed to understand how well debates align with truth-seeking. Despite its simplicity, this model captures key aspects of practical debates, including incentives to confuse or stall. Ongoing work seeks to expand these models to encompass a broader range of debate phenomena, ultimately aiming to improve the alignment of AI systems with human values and objectives.
