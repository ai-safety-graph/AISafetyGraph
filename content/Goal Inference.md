# Goal Inference

## Summary
 Goal inference is a crucial aspect of human-robot collaboration and intent understanding in AI systems. It involves predicting the objectives or intentions of human agents based on their observed behavior. This process enables robots and AI systems to adapt their actions in real-time, improving team performance and user satisfaction. Research has shown that combining goal inference with dynamic task planning significantly enhances both objective and perceived performance in human-robot teams. Moreover, recent approaches consider the possibility of suboptimal human behavior resulting from incorrect internal models of environment dynamics, rather than assuming near-optimal actions or known cognitive biases. By estimating these internal beliefs, more accurate models of human intent can be developed, leading to improved assistance in shared autonomy frameworks and better inference of human preferences.
