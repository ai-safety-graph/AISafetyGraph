# The Next Decade in AI Four Steps Towards Robust Artificial Intelligence
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.06177v3
## Abstract
Recent research in artificial intelligence and machine learning has largely emphasized general-purpose learning and ever-larger training sets and more and more compute. In contrast, I propose a hybrid, knowledge-driven, reasoning-based approach, centered around cognitive models, that could provide the substrate for a richer, more robust AI than is currently possible.
