# AI-Generating Algorithms

## Summary
 AI-Generating Algorithms (AI-GAs) represent an alternative approach to creating general artificial intelligence, distinct from the traditional "manual AI" method. This paradigm aims to develop algorithms that can automatically learn how to produce general AI, leveraging the trend in machine learning where learned solutions often outperform hand-designed ones. The AI-GA approach is built upon three essential pillars: meta-learning architectures, meta-learning the learning algorithms themselves, and generating effective learning environments. While both the manual AI and AI-GA approaches have the potential to achieve general AI, the author argues for increased research investment in AI-GAs due to their promise and inherent scientific interest. This approach not only offers a potentially faster path to general AI but also provides insights into the conditions under which a simple algorithm can produce sophisticated intelligence, mirroring the evolutionary process that led to human intelligence on Earth.
