# Computational Power and Social Impact

## Summary
 The subtopic "Computational Power and Social Impact" explores the intricate relationship between hardware capabilities and the development and deployment of artificial intelligence. While it's widely acknowledged that increased computational power has fueled recent AI breakthroughs, this topic delves deeper into how specific hardware characteristics, such as chip architectures and power consumption, influence the design, development, and real-world applications of machine learning models. The analysis extends beyond mere observations of increased processing capacity, examining how changes in computing architectures, methodologies, and supply chains may shape the future trajectory of AI. By tracing these connections between hardware and AI development, this area of research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the broader social impacts and potential risks associated with artificial intelligence, filling a gap in many existing analyses of AI's societal implications.
