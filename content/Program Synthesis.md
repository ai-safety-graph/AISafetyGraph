# Program Synthesis

## Summary
 Program synthesis in the context of AI alignment research involves using large language models and code generation capabilities to solve complex problems, particularly in fields like probability and statistics. This approach leverages models such as OpenAI's Codex, which is trained on both text and code, to transform written problems into executable programming tasks. The process often requires careful prompt engineering to reformulate questions into a format that can be accurately interpreted by the AI system. In the case of probability and statistics problems, the generated code typically simulates numerous probabilistic dependencies to compute solutions. This method has been successfully applied to university-level coursework, demonstrating the potential for AI to tackle advanced academic challenges. The development of such techniques contributes to the broader goal of creating AI systems that can understand, reason about, and solve complex problems in ways that align with human intent and expertise.
