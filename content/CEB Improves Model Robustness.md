# CEB Improves Model Robustness
http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05380v1
## Abstract
We demonstrate that the Conditional Entropy Bottleneck (CEB) can improve model robustness. CEB is an easy strategy to implement and works in tandem with data augmentation procedures. We report results of a large scale adversarial robustness study on CIFAR-10, as well as the ImageNet-C Common Corruptions Benchmark, ImageNet-A, and PGD attacks.
