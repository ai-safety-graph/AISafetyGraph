# Containment

## Summary
 Containment is a critical safety paradigm in AI development, particularly as awareness of potential impacts and concerns surrounding advanced AI grows. This approach aims to limit and control the capabilities and influence of AI systems, especially those that could potentially become malicious or adversarial. However, the effectiveness of containment strategies faces challenges, particularly when dealing with highly advanced or potentially malicious AI. The concept of "stovepiping" in containment mechanisms may lead to developmental blind spots, potentially compromising the overall safety of AI systems. As research in AI safety progresses, it is crucial to critically examine and refine containment methods to ensure they remain effective against increasingly sophisticated AI technologies, including generative adversarial networks and other advanced forms of artificial intelligence.
