# Decision Theory

## Summary
 Decision theory is a critical area of study for aligning advanced AI systems with human interests and developing rational decision-making procedures. Recent research has identified limitations in standard decision theory formulations and proposed new approaches to address these shortcomings. Functional Decision Theory (FDT) has emerged as a novel framework that outperforms traditional causal and evidential decision theories in various decision problems and game-theoretic scenarios. The theory of Cartesian frames offers a mathematical foundation for manipulating sets of actions and exploring their implications across different levels of description and agent interactions. These advancements in decision theory, along with concepts like policy selection and logical counterfactuals, provide promising avenues for future research in AI alignment and rational decision-making.
