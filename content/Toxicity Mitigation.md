# Toxicity Mitigation

## Summary
 The subtopic of Toxicity Mitigation in AI language models addresses the challenges and consequences of reducing harmful or offensive content generated by these systems. Researchers have explored various strategies to minimize toxicity in language model outputs, often relying on automatic evaluation metrics. However, critical analysis reveals that while basic intervention methods can improve toxicity scores according to established metrics, they may inadvertently introduce new biases and reduce the model's ability to accurately represent marginalized groups and their dialects. Furthermore, human evaluators frequently disagree with high toxicity scores produced by automatic systems after strong mitigation efforts, highlighting the complexity of accurately assessing and mitigating toxicity in language models. This underscores the importance of careful, nuanced evaluation approaches that consider both automatic metrics and human judgment to ensure the development of safe and inclusive AI language systems.
