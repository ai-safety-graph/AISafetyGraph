# AI Truthfulness

## Summary
 AI truthfulness is an emerging area of research focused on developing and governing AI systems that do not lie or spread misinformation. As AI systems become more sophisticated in generating verbal statements, there is a growing need to establish clear standards, institutions, and technologies to ensure AI truthfulness. This involves creating precise truthfulness standards for AI that can evolve over time, developing institutions capable of evaluating AI systems' adherence to these standards, and designing AI systems that are inherently truthful. Proposed approaches include avoiding negligent falsehoods, implementing pre- and post-deployment evaluation mechanisms, and explicitly training AI for truthfulness. However, challenges exist in balancing truthfulness requirements with potential risks of censorship or propaganda. Addressing AI truthfulness is crucial for maintaining public trust, supporting a healthy information ecosystem, and mitigating risks associated with advanced AI systems.
