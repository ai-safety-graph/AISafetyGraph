# Energy Requirements

## Summary
 The subtopic of Energy Requirements in AI alignment research explores the relationship between the energy consumption of the human brain and the potential energy constraints for artificial intelligence systems. While some have questioned whether the brain's energy usage might impose limits on AI feasibility, this line of inquiry reveals important distinctions between biological and artificial cognition. Estimates of brain bioenergetics and methods for calculating brain emulation energy needs provide a baseline for comparison. However, de novo AI systems may operate on fundamentally different principles, potentially utilizing more efficient, compressed processes that are not constrained by the same energy requirements as biological brains. This suggests that the energy demands of AI systems could be significantly different from, and possibly lower than, those of human brain emulations, challenging the notion that brain energy usage necessarily sets an upper limit on AI capabilities.
