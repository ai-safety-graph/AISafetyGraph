# AI Ethics and Governance

## Summary
 AI ethics and governance is a critical subtopic within the broader field of artificial intelligence research and development. A recent survey of machine learning researchers provides insight into the perspectives of this influential group on key ethical and governance issues. The survey reveals that AI/ML researchers generally trust international and scientific organizations to guide AI development in the public interest, while being more skeptical of military and certain tech companies' involvement. There is strong support among researchers for prioritizing AI safety research and implementing pre-publication review processes to assess potential harms. The survey also found that while researchers strongly oppose work on lethal autonomous weapons, they are less concerned about other military AI applications. These findings from AI/ML experts are valuable for informing policy discussions, regulatory frameworks, and governance strategies for artificial intelligence at both national and international levels.
