# Relational Inductive Bias

## Summary
 Relational inductive bias refers to the capacity for reasoning about inter-object relations and making decisions based on structured scene descriptions. This concept is crucial for tasks that require complex system manipulation, such as constructing or modifying a tower of blocks. While humans possess this ability, many current deep learning systems lack this relational reasoning capability, limiting their performance on structured tasks. Research has shown that incorporating relational inductive bias into artificial intelligence systems, through object- and relation-centric scene and policy representations, can lead to improved performance on complex tasks. In experiments involving block tower stabilization, AI agents with relational inductive bias outperformed both humans and more simplistic approaches, highlighting the importance of this concept in developing more intelligent and adaptable machines capable of solving structured reasoning problems.
