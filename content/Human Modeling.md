# Human Modeling

## Summary
 Human modeling in AI alignment research focuses on developing computational models that can accurately predict and interpret human behavior, decision-making, and cognitive processes. This field combines insights from game theory, cognitive psychology, and machine learning to create more effective human-robot interactions and improve AI systems' ability to understand and anticipate human actions. Recent advancements include integrating cognitive models into robotics planning and control, as well as using cognitive model priors to enhance machine learning predictions of human decisions under uncertainty. These approaches have shown promising results in improving the accuracy of human behavior predictions, particularly when dealing with limited data. The development of large-scale datasets for human decision-making is also contributing to the refinement of these models, providing valuable benchmarks for evaluating the effectiveness of various human modeling techniques in AI alignment research.
