# Incident Databases

## Summary
 The AI Incident Database is a crucial initiative in the field of AI alignment and safety, aimed at cataloging real-world failures of intelligent systems. Inspired by mature industries like aviation, which maintain incident databases to improve safety, this project addresses the lack of a collective memory for AI failures. By collecting and archiving over 1,000 incident reports, the database enables researchers, developers, and industry professionals to learn from past mistakes and prevent their recurrence. This resource supports various use cases through faceted and full-text search capabilities, allowing stakeholders to identify patterns, understand common pitfalls, and develop strategies to mitigate risks associated with AI deployment. Ultimately, the AI Incident Database serves as a vital tool for ensuring that intelligent systems are designed, developed, and implemented in ways that benefit people and society while avoiding repeated failures.
