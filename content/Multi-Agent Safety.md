# Multi-Agent Safety

## Summary
 Multi-Agent Safety is a critical area of research in AI alignment that focuses on developing strategies to promote cooperation among multiple AI agents while minimizing the risk of exploitation by malicious actors. Recent studies have highlighted an inherent trade-off between fostering cooperation and maintaining safety in multi-agent systems. However, research suggests that this trade-off is not necessarily severe, and significant benefits can be achieved through cooperation with relatively small amounts of risk. One proposed approach to address this challenge is the Accumulating Risk Capital Through Investing in Cooperation (ARCTIC) method, which aims to balance safety concerns with long-term cooperation objectives. This method has been evaluated in game-theoretic scenarios such as iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and Stag Hunt, demonstrating its potential for achieving a favorable balance between cooperative behavior and protection against exploitation in multi-agent environments.
