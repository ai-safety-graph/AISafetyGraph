# Robot Communication

## Summary
 Robot communication, particularly in expressing incapability, is a crucial aspect of human-robot interaction. Recent research has focused on developing methods for robots to effectively communicate their limitations to human users. One approach frames this as a trajectory optimization problem, aiming to maximize the similarity between the robot's motion when expressing incapability and what would be considered successful task execution, while adhering to the robot's physical constraints. This method not only conveys what the robot is attempting to do but also why it cannot accomplish the task. Studies have shown that such expressive motions can improve users' understanding of the robot's limitations, enhance their overall perception of the robot, and increase their willingness to collaborate with it in future interactions. This research highlights the importance of clear and intuitive robot communication in fostering better human-robot relationships and improving the effectiveness of robotic systems in various applications.
