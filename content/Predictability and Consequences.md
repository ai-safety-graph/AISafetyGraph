# Predictability and Consequences

## Summary
 The subtopic of Predictability and Consequences in AI alignment research explores the paradoxical nature of large-scale generative models, which exhibit both predictable performance on broad training distributions and unpredictable specific capabilities and outputs. This combination of characteristics poses significant challenges for anticipating the societal impacts of deploying such models. While the predictable aspects of these models drive rapid development and apparent usefulness, the unpredictable elements can lead to unforeseen and potentially harmful consequences. This tension creates complex motivations for model developers and deployment challenges, necessitating careful consideration of potential interventions to ensure beneficial outcomes. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for policymakers, technologists, and researchers involved in the development, regulation, and analysis of AI systems, as they work towards aligning these powerful models with human values and societal needs.
