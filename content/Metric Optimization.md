# Metric Optimization

## Summary
 Metric optimization is a crucial concept in AI alignment research that relates to Goodhart's Law, which describes the phenomenon where optimizing a system based on a specific metric can lead to unintended consequences or failure modes. This occurs when the metric is overoptimized to the point where further improvements become ineffective or even detrimental to the system's overall performance. The topic encompasses at least four distinct mechanisms that contribute to these failures, as identified by Garrabrant. Understanding these mechanisms is essential for addressing challenges in various fields, including economic regulation, public policy, machine learning, and AI alignment. The importance of recognizing and mitigating Goodhart effects becomes increasingly critical as AI systems gain more optimization power, making it a key focus area for ensuring the safe and effective development of artificial intelligence.
