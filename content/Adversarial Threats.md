# Adversarial Threats

## Summary
 Adversarial threats in AI alignment research refer to the potential interference of malicious actors or unintended adversarial influences on AI systems, particularly in reinforcement learning (RL) scenarios. This subtopic explores how to design and train AI systems that can maintain their intended behavior and goals even in the presence of adversaries attempting to manipulate or disrupt the learning process. The concept of Threatened Markov Decision Processes (TMDPs) provides a framework for addressing these challenges, allowing researchers to model and analyze decision-making processes under potential threats. Advanced techniques, such as level-k thinking schemes, are being developed to enhance AI systems' ability to reason about and counteract adversarial actions. This area of research is particularly crucial in security settings and other domains where the reliability and robustness of AI systems are paramount, as it aims to ensure that AI agents can learn and perform effectively even when faced with deliberate attempts to subvert their training or execution.
