# Justice and AI

## Summary
 The intersection of justice and artificial intelligence is a critical area of study as AI systems increasingly influence and shape society's core structures and institutions. Drawing on Rawlsian principles of distributive justice, researchers argue that AI deployed in socio-technical systems should be subject to egalitarian norms and standards of fairness. This implies that AI systems must meet requirements for public justification, support citizens' rights, and actively promote equitable outcomes. Particular emphasis is placed on considering and mitigating the impact of AI on society's most disadvantaged members. As AI becomes more deeply integrated into the basic structure of society, ensuring its alignment with principles of justice becomes essential for maintaining social equity and protecting the rights of all citizens. This emerging field of study seeks to develop frameworks and guidelines for creating and deploying AI systems that uphold ethical standards and contribute to a just society.
