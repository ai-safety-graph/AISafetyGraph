# Safety Envelopes

## Summary
 Safety envelopes represent a crucial approach in AI alignment research, aiming to provide safeguards for systems with potentially unsafe behaviors. This concept bridges the gap between fully known system dynamics and simple circuit breaker models. Dynamic safety envelopes offer a middle ground that allows for human oversight without the complications associated with constant human-in-the-loop systems. These envelopes can be adjusted based on heuristics and changing circumstances, providing a flexible yet robust method for ensuring system safety. This approach is particularly valuable for governing the deployment of systems that might otherwise be considered unsafe, offering a practical solution to balance the benefits of advanced AI systems with the need for responsible and controlled operation.
