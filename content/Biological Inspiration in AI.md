# Biological Inspiration in AI

## Summary
Biological Inspiration in AI is an innovative approach that leverages insights from biological organisms and neuropsychology to develop more advanced, safer, and better-aligned artificial intelligence systems. This multifaceted research area combines bottom-up and top-down methodologies, creating a comprehensive framework for AI development. The bottom-up approach involves developing biophysically accurate simulations of simple organisms to inform AI algorithms and architectures, while the top-down approach focuses on grounding AI goal structures in neuropsychological principles to enhance value alignment. By drawing inspiration from embodied organisms with sensorimotor integration, researchers aim to create more robust and aligned AI systems. This biologically-inspired approach not only has the potential to revolutionize AI safety and functionality but also benefits from its roots in established scientific traditions and alignment with current themes in biological and psychological sciences, such as data/model integration and reproducibility.
