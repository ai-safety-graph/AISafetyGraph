# Biological Inspiration in AI

## Summary
Biological Inspiration in AI is an innovative approach that leverages insights from nature and neuroscience to enhance artificial intelligence systems. A key aspect of this field is Biologically-Inspired AI Safety, which combines bottom-up and top-down strategies to develop safer and more aligned AI. The bottom-up approach involves creating detailed simulations of simple organisms to inform AI algorithms, while the top-down method focuses on grounding AI goal structures in neuropsychology. By drawing inspiration from biological organisms and their sensorimotor integration, researchers aim to create more robust and aligned AI systems. This approach not only benefits from established research traditions but also aligns with current themes in biological and psychological sciences, such as data/model integration and reproducibility. Ultimately, biological inspiration in AI holds promise for developing more advanced, safer, and better-aligned artificial intelligence systems that can potentially mimic the adaptability and efficiency of natural biological systems.
