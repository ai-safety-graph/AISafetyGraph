# Verification and Validation

## Summary
Verification and validation in AI alignment research face significant challenges and fundamental limitations. While these processes aim to ensure the safety and reliability of advanced AI systems, there are inherent computational and practical barriers to achieving absolute certainty. Research has shown that verifying an AI agent's adherence to specific behavioral standards is not computationally feasible, and both manual proofs and automated governance systems encounter substantial obstacles. Attempts to ensure decidability of behavioral standards may require limiting the AI's capabilities, while validating outcomes in the physical world proves futile. Furthermore, commonly proposed solutions like layered architectures are deemed inadequate for providing robust guarantees. These findings underscore the importance of recognizing the inherent limitations in AI safety and adjusting the language and expectations surrounding general AI safety discussions accordingly.
