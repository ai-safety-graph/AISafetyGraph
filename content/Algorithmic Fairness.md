# Algorithmic Fairness

## Summary
 Algorithmic fairness is a critical concern in the application of machine learning to automated decision-making systems. This subtopic explores the challenges of incorporating social concepts like justice and fairness into predictive frameworks. Researchers have proposed various metrics and algorithms to quantify and mitigate deviations from statistical parities expected in a fair world. However, the field of fair machine learning has faced limitations similar to those encountered in the ideal approach of political philosophy. By focusing solely on closing discrepancies between the real world and an idealized just world, these approaches may overlook crucial factors such as the mechanisms behind existing inequalities, decision-makers' responsibilities, and the potential impacts of proposed interventions. This has led to growing recognition of the shortcomings in current fair machine learning algorithms and the need for more nuanced, context-aware approaches that consider the complexities of real-world scenarios and the potential unintended consequences of algorithmic interventions.
