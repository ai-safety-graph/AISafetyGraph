# Human-Centered AI

## Summary
 Human-Centered AI (HCAI) is an approach to artificial intelligence and machine learning that emphasizes the importance of designing AI systems with a deep understanding of human contexts and needs. This perspective recognizes that AI algorithms are part of a larger sociotechnical system involving human users and stakeholders. HCAI encompasses two key aspects: (1) developing AI systems that can comprehend and adapt to human sociocultural contexts, and (2) creating AI systems that are transparent and interpretable to humans. This approach aims to address critical issues of social responsibility in AI, including fairness, accountability, and transparency. By prioritizing human factors in AI design and development, HCAI seeks to create more effective, ethical, and user-friendly AI systems that can seamlessly integrate into human environments and enhance human capabilities rather than replace them.
