# AI Security and Privacy

## Summary
AI Security and Privacy is a critical area of research and development in artificial intelligence, focusing on protecting both the integrity of AI models and the sensitive data they process. This multifaceted field addresses challenges such as safeguarding deep neural networks against malicious attacks during training and inference, developing robust defenses to maintain model efficiency, and ensuring the privacy of training data. Key concerns include preventing poisoning and evasion attacks on models, as well as protecting against data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information. Researchers are exploring various techniques to enhance security and privacy, including methods to identify and remove malicious data, train models to resist adversarial examples, and implement privacy-preserving technologies like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption. As AI systems become increasingly prevalent in critical applications, the importance of balancing model performance with robust security and privacy measures continues to grow, presenting ongoing challenges and opportunities for innovation in the field.
