# Self-Taught AI

## Summary
 Self-Taught AI, exemplified by the Autodidactic Iteration algorithm described in the paper on solving the Rubik's Cube, represents a significant advancement in artificial intelligence that enables agents to learn complex tasks with minimal human supervision. This approach combines deep reinforcement learning with self-play techniques, allowing AI systems to develop problem-solving skills in challenging domains without relying on human data or domain knowledge. The success of this method in solving the Rubik's Cube, a complex combinatorial optimization problem with sparse rewards, demonstrates its potential for tackling other difficult tasks. By achieving superhuman proficiency and efficiency in solving the cube, Self-Taught AI showcases its ability to generalize and adapt to complex environments, paving the way for more autonomous and capable AI systems in various fields.
