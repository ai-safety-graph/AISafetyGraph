# Diagnostic Tasks

## Summary
 The subtopic of Diagnostic Tasks in AI alignment research focuses on developing simple, targeted environments to evaluate specific aspects of reward and imitation learning algorithms. Unlike complex, realistic benchmarks, these diagnostic tasks are designed to isolate individual components of algorithm performance, allowing for faster, more reliable testing and easier identification of failure points. The DERAIL (Diagnostic Environments for Reward And Imitation Learning) suite, as described in the given abstract, provides such a set of diagnostic tasks. These environments enable researchers to assess various reward and imitation learning algorithms, revealing the sensitivity of their performance to implementation details. Additionally, these diagnostic tasks can be used to identify design flaws in existing algorithms and rapidly test potential improvements, as demonstrated in a case study involving preference-based reward learning.
