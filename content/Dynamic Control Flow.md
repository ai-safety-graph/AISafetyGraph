# Dynamic Control Flow

## Summary
 Dynamic control flow is a crucial feature in modern machine learning systems, particularly for models based on recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning. It enables rapid, data-dependent decision-making across distributed computing devices, enhancing performance, scalability, and expressiveness. The implementation of dynamic control flow in distributed and heterogeneous environments, as demonstrated in TensorFlow, extends the use of dataflow graphs to represent machine learning models. This approach allows for the partitioning of conditional branches and loop bodies across various machines and devices, supports automatic differentiation and distributed gradient computations for training, and employs non-strict semantics to enable parallel execution of loop iterations across machines. These features have proven valuable in both research and production environments, offering improved performance and scalability for complex machine learning applications.
