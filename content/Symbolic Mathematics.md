# Symbolic Mathematics

## Summary
 Symbolic Mathematics is an area where neural networks have demonstrated unexpected proficiency, challenging the notion that they are primarily suited for statistical or approximate problems. Recent research has shown that deep learning models can effectively handle complex mathematical tasks like symbolic integration and solving differential equations. By developing specialized syntaxes for representing mathematical problems and generating large-scale training datasets, researchers have created sequence-to-sequence models capable of outperforming established commercial Computer Algebra Systems such as Matlab and Mathematica. This breakthrough suggests that artificial intelligence can make significant contributions to advanced mathematical problem-solving, potentially revolutionizing the field of symbolic computation and opening new avenues for AI applications in mathematics and related disciplines.
